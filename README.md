What is a GIT commit: 
====================
A commit is like a snapshot of all the files in your project at a particular point in time.
When you created your new repository, you initialized it with a README file. README files are a great place to describe your project in more detail, or add some documentation such as how to install or use your project. The contents of your README file are automatically shown on the front page of your repository.
